# Activity Docker Compose

In this activity, you will deploy a Machine Learning model with the [Diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py), which is included in Scikit Learn.

## Instructions

* Convert that model to a Fastapi API and test the code.
* Implement a unit test
* Implement Logging.
* Implement the all best practices.
* Dockerize the application:
  * The app/api in one container
  * The logic/model in another container.

It is expected to have a structure similar to that seen in the exercise.
